#Contrive

Contrive is an authentication and authorization system for ASP.NET.

Contrive is (mostly) backwards compatable with the ASP.NET Membership Provider. (Contrive does not support secret question/answer of mailing passwords in plain text)

Contrive is intended to mimic the ease of installation and configuration
found in [Devise] (https://github.com/plataformatec/devise).

Contrive was influenced by and borrows liberally from:
