#Contrive

Contrive is an authentication and authorization system for ASP.NET.

Contrive is backwards compatable with the ASP.NET Membership Provider.

Contrive is intended to mimic the ease of installation and configuration
found in [Devise] (https://github.com/plataformatec/devise).

Contrive was influenced by and borrows liberally from:
