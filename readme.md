#Contrive

Contrive is a collection of utilities for Microsoft .NET.

Contrive contains an authentication and authorization system.

Contrive is currently incomplete and crappy. Most of these tools are in use in production applications, but have not been fully cleaned up and made general purpose for public consumption.

Contrive was influenced by and borrows liberally from:
